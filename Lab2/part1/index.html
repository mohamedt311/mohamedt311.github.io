          In casual language, people use “bugs” to mean all sorts of small
          creepy-crawlies: insects, spiders, etc. However, “Bugs” (true bugs)
          are actually just one order of insects (Hemiptera). This page
          provides a summary of the main classes or groups of
          creepy-crawlies.

        <h2>🪲 Beetles (Coleoptera)</h2>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/beetle.png" alt="Stag beetle with large mandibles" width="250" height="180" />
          <figcaption>Beetles have hardened forewings (elytra) forming a protective shell.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Beetles make up the largest order of insects, with more than 350,000 known species. They are recognized by their hardened forewings (elytra) that cover and protect the delicate hindwings and abdomen. This feature gives them a tough, armored look and helps them survive in many environments, from forests to deserts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many beetles play important ecological roles. Some, like ladybugs, are beneficial predators that feed on crop pests. Others, such as dung beetles, recycle nutrients. However, some species like the Colorado potato beetle are major agricultural pests.

        <h2>🐛 True Bugs (Hemiptera)</h2>

          <img src="images/true_bug.jpg" alt="Dock bug with piercing mouthparts" width="250" height="180" />
          <figcaption>True bugs have piercing-sucking mouthparts adapted for feeding.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          True bugs include stink bugs, cicadas, aphids, and water striders. Their forewings are partly hardened and partly membranous, and they possess distinctive piercing-sucking mouthparts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some species are beneficial, while others are destructive pests that weaken plants or even bite humans.

        <figure>
          <img src="images/butterfly.jpg" alt="Swallowtail butterfly on a flower" width="250" height="180" />
          <figcaption>Butterflies and moths have wings covered in tiny scales.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Recognized by their colorful wings, butterflies are usually active by day, while moths are nocturnal. Both undergo complete metamorphosis.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are vital pollinators and an important food source for many animals.

          <figcaption>Diptera have only one pair of functional wings and halteres for balance.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Flies and mosquitoes are highly agile due to their specialized wings. Some are decomposers, while mosquitoes are known vectors of disease.

          <figcaption>Many species are social insects that live in colonies.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Bees are pollinators and honey producers, wasps often predators, and ants cooperative foragers. They play critical ecological roles worldwide.

          <figcaption>Spiders spin silk to create webs, egg sacs, or safety lines.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Spiders are arachnids with eight legs. Nearly all are predators, using venom and silk to capture prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are important controllers of insect populations and rarely pose danger to humans.
